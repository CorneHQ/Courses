# Week 02: Branching Programs

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for week 02. In Week 02, you will learn basics of Python structures to add decision points to your linear programs. A branching program is a flow of sequential instructions with branching statements. By the end this week, you will be able to implement a program where a user can enter simple input, the program can make choices based on some conditions and after calculation results can be printed as output.
