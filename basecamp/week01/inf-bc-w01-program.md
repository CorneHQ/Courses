Week 01:

Week-01 Activities:

* Week-01-Day-01: What is a Program?

+ R-01: Chapter 01:
- What is a general definition of a program? Make (none-computer) examples.
- What are the main elements of a program?
- Take some simple python programs and try to guess what does each program do. Discuss.
- Find a python program. Name five different syntactical elements of the program. Define semantics of two elements of the program.

+ R-01: Appendix B:
- Install Python on your machine.
- Open a terminal (command window) and check the version of your Python. What is the command?
- Create a file and name it: hello.py (make sure the extension of the file is py). Open the file and use print statement to print a given text, like Hello Python. Save the file and using your terminal execute your first python program.

+ R-01: Chapter 01-Things to Do:
- Finish all the items in "Things to Do".

+ Exercises:

* Week-01-Day-02: Everything starts with Data.

+ (Free Search):
- What are the main hardware elements of a computer?
- What is an Operating System and why do we need it?
- How data (values) are stored / extracted / computed in a computer? (keywords: bytes, bits, ram memory, hard disks, cpu registers)

+ R-01: Chapter 02:
> Teachers Note: There are some concepts that students may not be able to grasp completely. The main idea is to try as much as possible. It will be more clear for the students later when they learn OO programming in Python.

- What is a "type"? Provide five examples.
- What is a value? What is a variable?
- How can you define a variable in Python? 
- Define some variables in Python that are not permitted in Python. Experiment with breaking various rules in defining variables. Analyse the error message.
- How can you assign a value to a variable? How can we express that two items are equal?
- How can you identify the type of a value / variable?

+ R-01: Chapter 02-Things to Do:
- Finish all the items in "Things to Do".

+ (Free Search):
- What are the character and string types in Python? Make examples.
- You have learned how to print something as an output of your program. How can you read something as input? What is the function? What is the type?

+ Exercises:
[todo]


* Week-01-Day-03: Expressions make calculations.

+ R-01: Chapter 03:

- Name basic built-in data types in Python. Use examples.
- What are the basic arithmetic operations? 
- Why "precedences" are important?
- How can you convert one data type to another? Name basic built-in functions.

+ R-01: Chapter 03-Things to Do:
- Finish all the items in "Things to Do".

+ Exercises:
- Implement a program (name days-to-hms.py) that a user can: (1) enter number of days as input, and (2) prints number of hours, minutes and seconds separately as output.
- Experiment the behaviour of days-to-hms.py when: (1) input is a negative number, (2) input is a mix of letters and numbers.
- [todo]

* Week-01-Day-04: Product

[todo: the main idea is to review, practice more and develop weekly product]

* Week-01-Day-05: Reflection.

[todo: The main idea is to reflect and summarize what is learned.]
